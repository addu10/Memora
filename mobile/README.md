# Memora Mobile App

A premium React Native (Expo) mobile application for Alzheimer's patients to engage in memory therapy sessions, featuring a soothing light-themed UI and AI-driven reminiscence therapy.

## 🌟 Overview

The Memora Mobile App is designed for elderly patients with early-stage Alzheimer's disease. It prioritizes accessibility, visual comfort, and cognitive engagement through:

- **Premium Light Theme**: High-contrast "White-Lavender" aesthetics with glassmorphism and smooth gradients.
- **Face Recognition (V2)**: Instant family identification using DeepFace and Supabase Edge Functions.
- **AI-Powered Therapy**: Personalized interactive prompts generated by AI to stimulate memory.
- **Slideshow Mode**: Soothing, auto-advancing memory slideshows with ambient transitions.
- **Memory Performance**: Visual tracking of recall progress (Mastered, In Progress, Needs Practice).
- **Proactive Safety**: Global Error Boundaries and Network Connectivity monitoring.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Framework**: React Native with **Expo SDK 54**
- **Architecture**: React Native 0.81 (Standard Architecture)
- **Engine**: **React 19.1**
- **Animations**: React Native Reanimated v4
- **Navigation**: Expo Router (v6+ Typed Routing)
- **Storage**: AsyncStorage with Supabase Auth persistence

## 🔐 Authentication Flow

1. **Secure Access**: Patients log in using a 4-digit PIN matched via `login_patient` RPC.
2. **Session Persistence**: Authentication state is managed via Supabase and cached in `AsyncStorage`.
3. **Safety First**: Any failed attempt provides graceful feedback via standardized `StatusModals`.

## ⚙️ Developer Setup

Refer to the [DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md](file:///c:/Users/adnan/Documents/Final%20Year/mobile/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md) for detailed installation instructions. 

### Note on Installation
Due to the cutting-edge nature of React 19 in Expo SDK 54, you **must** use the following command for a successful install:
```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

## 🎨 Design Principles

- **Accessibility**: Extra large typography (up to 32px), high-contrast labels, and simplified navigation paths.
- **Visual Comfort**: A curated "White-Lavender" palette reducing eye strain and cognitive overwhelm.
- **Feedback**: Haptic-like visual feedback and micro-animations to confirm all user actions.
- **Robustness**: Proactive error handling and offline state indicators tailored for an elderly user base.
