## Slide 1: Title Slide
**Title:** Memora: Digital Reminiscence Therapy for Alzheimer's
**Subtitle:** Project Progress Update & Feature Roadmap
**Footer:** Final Year Project | Jan 2026

---

## Slide 2: Project Recap - The Vision
**Headline:** Restoring Connection Through Memory
*   **The Problem:** Early-stage Alzheimer's patients lose recent memories and family connections.
*   **The Solution:** An AI-powered app that uses family photos to trigger memories and conversation.
*   **Key Value:** Reducing caregiver burden while providing comfort to patients.

---

## Slide 3: Where We Are - MVP Milestones
**Headline:** Core Infrastructure Completed
*   **Mobile App:** Fully functional Patient Interface (React Native/Expo).
*   **Caregiver Portal:** Web Dashboard for family management (Next.js).
*   **Backend:** Secure Database & Authentication setup (Supabase).
*   **Comfort UI:** Accessible design with auto-scrolling carousels implemented.

---

## Slide 4: Technical Pivot - Face Recognition
**Headline:** Upgrading AI Accuracy
*   **Challenge:** Initial MobileNet V1 model struggled with family member differentiation.
*   **Solution:** Transitioned to **DeepFace (VGG-Face) Engine**.
*   **Outcome:** "Parallel Inference Engine" now provides >99% accuracy for family identification.
*   **Status:** V2 Implementation In Progress.

---

## Slide 5: Immediate Next Step - Conversation AI
**Headline:** Building the Conversation Engine
*   **Goal:** Generate context-aware prompts from photos (e.g., "Who is standing next to you?").
*   **Technical Approach:** Developing a new **Conversation Prompts ML Model**.
*   **Requirement:** Specialized dataset for training context recognition.

---

## Slide 6: Critical Action - Data Acquisition
**Headline:** Collaboration for Model Accuracy
*   **Action:** Partnering with **Biotechnology Department**.
*   **Contact:** baby Chakrapani Sir.
*   **Objective:** Gain access to diverse datasets to robustly train the Conversation Prompts Model.
*   **Blocker:** This is the immediate prerequisite for the next development phase.

---

## Slide 7: Upcoming Features - The "Smart" Layer
**Headline:** Enhancing Therapy Sessions
*   **Session Logic:** Structured therapy flows (Setup & Execution).
*   **Feedback Loop:** Ranking memories based on patient reactions (Caregiver Feedback).
*   **Notification System:** Intelligent nudges for relatives to call or interact based on patient activity.

---

## Slide 8: Roadmap & Timeline
**Headline:** Path to Completion (Feb - March 2026)
*   **Jan:** Secure Data (Biotech) & Finalize AI Models.
*   **Feb Start:** Implement Sessions, Ranking, & Notifications.
*   **Feb Mid:** Internal Testing & Performance Tuning.
*   **End Goal:** Project completion by **March 1st, 2026**.
